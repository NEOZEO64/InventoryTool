# Inventory management tool

- inventory.json contains all my electronic parts. I want to build an analog synthesizer so they have become more and more. I loose the overview right now.
- This tool should introduce **clarity**, what components I have.
- This tool should answer the following questions
    - Can I build the device I want? Enough parts?
    - What can I do with the components else?
    - (Deliver me datasheets)

## Features now implemented
- filtering my components (this may be even enough)
- elegant CLI-physics
- simple syntax highlighting

## Wished Features
- adding / removing components (but maybe I just keep adding them by hand in json)
- datasheet link to my folder


## ToDo
- Describe single components with more categories
    - how much are in stock
    - price
    - ...
