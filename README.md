# Inventory management tool

- This tool should provide **clarity**, which components I have.
- This tool should answer the following questions
    - Can I build the device I want? Do I have enough parts?
    - (What else can I do with the components?)
    - (Deliver me datasheets)

inventory.json contains all my electronic parts
I want to build an analog synthesizer so they have become more and more. (I am loosing the overview right now)

## Features now implemented
- filtering my components (this may be even enough)
- elegant CLI-physics with easy shell
- simple syntax highlighting
- All components fully listed now (approximated stock, categories etc.)

## Wished Features
- adding / removing components (but maybe I just keep adding them by hand in json)
- datasheet link
- BOM (Bill of Materials) Management so I can see which devices I can build
